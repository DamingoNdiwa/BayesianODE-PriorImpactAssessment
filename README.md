# BayesianODE-PriorImpactAssessment
This repository has code for the paper Prior impact assessment for dynamical systems described by ordinary differential equations.
## examples
The examples folder contains two subfolders: lotka_volterra and the SEIR.
### lotka_volterra
The script `wasser_dist_prior.py` should be run last as it relies on results from other scripts.
### SEIR
